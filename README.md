# ZyboZ7020_LedButton Project

## Introduction
This project is designed for the Zybo Z7020 development board, focusing on utilizing LEDs and buttons to demonstrate basic input/output functionality. It serves as an educational tool for understanding the interaction between hardware components and software logic on the Zybo Z7020 platform.

## Features
- LED control via button press
- Demonstration of basic VHDL programming concepts
- Introduction to FPGA-based design and development

## Requirements
- Xilinx Vivado Design Suite
- Zybo Z7020 development board

## Installation
To get started with the ZyboZ7020_LedButton project, clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
git clone https://github.com/KaanErgun/ZyboZ7020_LedButton.git


## Usage
After cloning the repository, open the project in Vivado Design Suite. You will need to program your Zybo Z7020 board with the provided bitstream file. Once programmed, you can interact with the LEDs using the onboard buttons.
